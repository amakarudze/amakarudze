### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a Python/Django Developer currently working for ButterCMS. Since 2020 I have been the President of the DSF (Django Software Foundation) and was previously a Software Engineer at BriteCore. I am based in Harare, Zimbabwe and have been working remotely for a couple of years now.

I have over 12 years of experience in the ICT sector and previously held multiple positions in Zimbabwe and globally. I received a BSc (Hons.) in Computer Science from Midlands State University and an MSc in Strategic Management from Chinhoyi University.

Since 2015 I have focused on Python/Django development and have been very active in the community as a conference speaker, Django Girls Trustee, and member of the DSFâ€™s Code of Conduct Committee. Since 2018 I have served on the DSF Board of Directors and held the position of Vice President (2019-2020) and currently President (2021-present).

I am the lead maintainer of the open source [Django Girls repo](https://github.com/DjangoGirls/djangogirls) where I write code, update documentation, review pull requests, and maintain the server. Recent work includes updating the project from Django 2.0 to 3.2 in stages and improving the layout.


- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a [scripts](https://github.com/amakarudze/scripts) project for automating creating new Django projects using Docker.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning data structures and algorithms in Python when I am not working on my projects.
